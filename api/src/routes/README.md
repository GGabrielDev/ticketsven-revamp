### TODO LIST:

- Remove redundant comments
- Create a proper documentation for this folder containing:
  - All routes, possible parameters and queries and their expected returns.
  - Brief explanations of all routes (Pairing some routes under the CRUD umbrella is fine, but explain any differences).
  - Explain reasons for the use of Authorization Middleware on some cases
- Use a tool to have an interactive test ground to evaluate routes safely.
- Remember to do in both, English and Spanish.
